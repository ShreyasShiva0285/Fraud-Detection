# Fraud Detection

**Fraud Detection** is a machine learning-powered application designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. The tool analyzes transaction data to assess the likelihood of fraud based on patterns and historical data. It helps financial institutions and businesses in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities.

## Project Overview

The Fraud Detection application uses machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. By analyzing features such as transaction amount, time, location, and other financial indicators, the system provides real-time insights into potential fraud. The application provides actionable alerts, helping organizations take immediate action.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Analyzes incoming transaction data and classifies it as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Probability-Based Alerts**: Provides probability scores for fraud likelihood, enabling risk-based decision-making.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit, the app presents predictions and insights in an interactive interface.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature engineering and normalization techniques for better model performance.
- **Model Explainability**: The app provides insights into model decisions using techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations).

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for real-time interactive interface)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasShiva0285/Fraud-detection.git
2. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required dependencies via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
How it Works
Data Input: Users input transaction details such as the transaction amount, time, and other relevant data into the app.

Model Prediction: The backend machine learning model processes the data and outputs a fraud probability score.

Output: The app displays a fraud detection prediction along with a confidence score. It also provides insights into why the transaction is classified as fraudulent or legitimate.

Use Case
This fraud detection system is useful for banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce platforms to identify suspicious activity in real-time. It can help prevent financial losses by detecting fraudulent transactions as they occur and offering insights into what makes the transaction suspicious.
